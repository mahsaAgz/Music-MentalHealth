There are four lab assignments cover various data science techniques.
And a project that investigates the relationship between music habits and mental health.

## Lab Assignments
The lab assignments explore different aspects of data science, including sentiment analysis, survey sampling, and ethical considerations in research.

- [Lab 1: Trump's Tweets](./Lab_Assignments/Trump's_tweets.pdf)
This assignment investigates the engagement patterns of **Donald Trumpâ€™s tweets** using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling** and **sentiment analysis**. The study examines how different tweet topics and sentiments influence user interaction.
